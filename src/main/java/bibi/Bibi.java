/**
 * A chatbot that stores ToDos, deadlines, and events.
 *
 * <p>This class only wires the parts together and carries out one request at a
 * time. {@link Ui} does the talking, {@link Parser} makes sense of what the user
 * typed, a {@link Command} carries the request out, {@link TaskList} holds the
 * tasks, and {@link Storage} keeps them on disk.
 *
 * <p>Two front ends drive it. {@link #run()} is the console conversation loop.
 * {@link #getGreeting()} and {@link #getResponse(String)} serve the GUI, which
 * cannot loop on standard input because JavaFX owns the thread. Both routes run
 * one command through {@link #executeCommand(String)}; only what happens to
 * the words differs.
