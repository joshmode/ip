/**

 * <p>This class owns the mechanics of the conversation: the prompt, the divider
 * lines, the {@code Bibi:} prefix, and the numbering of listed tasks. Wording
 * that belongs to one particular operation is passed in by the caller, so that
 * adding a command does not mean adding a method here.
 *
 * <p>Every line leaves through {@link #write(String)}, which either prints to the
 * console or collects the line in memory. Collecting is what lets the GUI reuse
 * the commands unchanged: it asks for the same work to be done, then takes the
 * text that would have been printed and puts it in a dialog box instead.
 *
 * <p>Keeping all console access in one place means the rest of the program never
 * calls {@code System.out} directly, which is what makes the other classes
 * testable without capturing console output.
