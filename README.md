And it is FREE!

## Setting up in Intellij

Prerequisites: JDK 25, update Intellij to the most recent version.

1. Open Intellij (if you are not in the welcome screen, click `File` > `Close Project` to close the existing project first)
1. Open the project into Intellij as follows:
   1. Click `Open`.
   1. Select the project directory, and click `OK`.
   1. If there are any further prompts, accept the defaults.
1. Configure the project to use **JDK 25** (not other versions) as explained in [here](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/sdk.html#set-up-jdk).<br>
   In the same dialog, set the **Project language level** field to the `SDK default` option.
1. After that, locate the `src/main/java/bibi/Launcher.java` file, right-click it, and choose `Run Launcher.main()` (if the code editor is showing compile errors, try restarting the IDE). If the setup is correct, a window opens showing Bibi's greeting, with a box to type commands into.
1. The text-based interface is still there. Run `src/main/java/bibi/Bibi.java` the same way to get it, and it greets you in the console with the banner:
   ```
   B B B B    i    b b b    i
   B       B       b       b
   B B B B   iii   b b b b  iii
   B       B  i    b       b  i
   B B B B  iii   b b b b  iii
   ```

**Note:** always start the GUI from `Launcher`, never from `Main`. JavaFX refuses to start when the class holding `main` extends `Application` and the JavaFX runtime is on the classpath, which is how this project supplies it; the error reads `JavaFX runtime components are missing`.

**Warning:** Keep the `src\main\java` folder as the root folder for Java files (i.e., don't rename those folders or move Java files to another folder outside of this folder path), as this is the default location some tools (e.g., Gradle) expect to find Java files.

## Building and running with Gradle

The project uses the Gradle wrapper, so no separate Gradle install is needed.
Run these from the project root, with JDK 25 selected.

Compile everything:

```
./gradlew compileJava
```

Run the chatbot. This opens the GUI:

```
./gradlew run
```

The text-based interface has its own task. It is what the scripted UI tests
drive, since a console is far easier to feed a script than a window is:

```
./gradlew runCli
```

On Windows `cmd`, use `gradlew.bat` instead of `./gradlew`.

Both interfaces are the same chatbot underneath, and both save to
`./data/bibi.txt`, relative to the folder the build runs in.

## Checking the coding standard

The build applies [Checkstyle](https://checkstyle.org) to enforce the
[SE-EDU intermediate Java coding standard](https://se-education.org/guides/conventions/java/intermediate.html)
mechanically, so style is settled by the tool rather than by argument in review.
The rules live in `config/checkstyle/checkstyle.xml`, with narrow exemptions in
`config/checkstyle/suppressions.xml`.

Run it on its own:

```
./gradlew checkstyleMain checkstyleTest
```

Checkstyle also runs as part of `./gradlew check` and `./gradlew build`, so a
style violation fails the build the same way a failing test does.

When something is flagged, the console names the file, line, and rule. A browsable
report is written to `build/reports/checkstyle/main.html` (and `test.html`).

Note that the build sets `maxWarnings = 0`. Most rules in the SE-EDU config carry
severity `warning`, and Gradle fails a Checkstyle task on errors only, so without
that setting those rules would be reported and then ignored.

## Packaging as a runnable JAR

The build uses the Shadow plugin to produce a *fat* JAR: one file containing the
compiled classes and any dependencies, so nothing else needs to be installed
alongside it.

Create it:

```
./gradlew shadowJar
```

The result is written to `build/libs/bibi.jar`. That folder is ignored by Git,
because generated binaries do not belong in the repository; publish the JAR
through a GitHub release instead.

Run it from any folder. This opens the GUI:

```
java -jar "bibi.jar"
```

The same JAR still holds the text-based interface:

```
java -cp "bibi.jar" bibi.Bibi
```

Bibi creates its `data/bibi.txt` save file relative to the folder the command is
run in, so copying the JAR into an empty folder gives it a fresh task list, and
running it there again restores what was saved.

### AI assistance

This project was built with heavy use of **Claude (Opus 5), through Claude Code**,
by [@joshmode](https://github.com/joshmode). The use was widespread rather than
localised, so it is cited here rather than in individual comments, as the course
policy on reuse directs.

Concretely, the assistant was used to:

- draft and refactor most of the Java across the increments, including the JavaFX
  interface, the parser, and the command classes;
- write the JUnit tests and the scripted console tests, and diagnose the failures
  they surfaced;
- write the commit messages, pull request descriptions, and this documentation.

Design decisions — what each feature should do, how errors should behave, and what
the product should feel like — were made in conversation rather than delegated, and
every change was reviewed and verified before being merged.

### Course materials

The structure of the JavaFX interface follows the
[JavaFX tutorial @SE-EDU](https://se-education.org/guides/tutorials/javaFx.html), and
the Checkstyle rules are the ones published with
[addressbook-level3](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/config/checkstyle).
Crediting course materials is not required, but is done here for completeness.
